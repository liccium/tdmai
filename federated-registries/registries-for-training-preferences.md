# Registries for Training Preferences

## A Simple, Standards-Based Approach

Creators and rightsholders can make their AI training preferences heard using **a registry-based model for rights declarations**. At the heart of this model lies a simple yet powerful principle: **declare your intent once, and make it globally discoverable**.

This is made possible through **federated content registries** – public, open, and verifiable directories that store and disseminate metadata about how digital works may be used, particularly in contexts like **text and data mining (TDM)** and **AI model training**.

TDM·AI supports declarations built on a shared vocabulary and identifier system, including:

* **ISCC codes** for uniquely identifying content
* **Standardized opt-out expressions**
* **Machine-readable formats** for easy integration and compliance

## Why This Matters

In today's digital ecosystem, works are collected, processed, and sometimes reused without direct contact between the creator and the user. Registries provide a missing link: a reliable way to declare rights and usage restrictions in a **standardized and resolvable format**.

This approach offers:

* **Transparency**: Declarations are publicly visible and verifiable.
* **Consistency**: A common format ensures uniform interpretation across platforms.
* **Scalability**: Billions of records can be indexed and queried efficiently.
* **Neutrality**: No dependency on any specific vendor, platform, or technology provider.

With a registry, the declaration lives outside any individual website or platform, increasing the **likelihood of recognition and enforcement**.
