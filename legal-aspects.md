# Legal Aspects

### The EU Copyright Directive

[Article 4 of the EU Copyright Directive 2019/790 (DSM Directive)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790) requires EU Member States to provide an "exception \[...] of this Directive for reproductions and extractions of lawfully accessible works and other subject matter for the purposes of text and data mining", which is defined as "any automated analytical technique aimed at analysing text and data in digital form in order to generate information which includes but is not limited to patterns, trends and correlations".

The DSM Directive distinguishes between TDM for scientific purposes and for other purposes. Article 3 provides a provision for scientific purposes, while Article 4 regulates all other purposes. Although Article 4 does not explicitly mention any specific, non-scientific purposes of TDM, it is assumed that acts of training models of AI include acts of TDM as an essential element. The applicability of this type of use for AI training has been debated among legal scholars, but since the new European AI Act explicitly mentions the applicability of TDM for AI training, this discussion is considered to be resolved and clear by most.

Article 4 (3) further elaborates that "the exception or limitation provided for in paragraph shall apply on condition that the use of works and other subject matter referred to in that paragraph has not been expressly reserved by their rightholders in an appropriate manner, such as machine-readable means in the case of content made publicly available online."&#x20;

### International Applicability of the DSM

The AI Act and the obligation to respect TDM opt-out raise complex questions about their territorial application. If an AI provider in the US trains an AI model, using servers and content available in the US, it is questionable whether this provider must respect TDM opt-out declarations. The AI Act assumes that the provider must respect the declaration at least when marketing these models in the EU or in the EEA.

Traditionally, copyright laws are territorial in the sense that reproductions during AI model training are governed by the copyright laws of the country where the training occurs, this would suggest the applicability of US law to the case.The DSM Directive, including its opt-out provision for text and data mining (TDM), is European Union (EU) legislation. As such, it primarily applies to EU member states and the acts of using copyrighted works on EU territory.&#x20;

However, the scope of the AI Act, referring to these copyright provisions goes beyond this regulation. The AI Act applies to any provider placing AI models on the EU market, regardless of their location (Art. 53 (1) lit. c) AI Act). This means even if the AI training occurs outside the EU, the model must comply with the AI Act when the model or an application based thereon is offered in the EU. The Act's goal is to ensure fair competition and protect individual rights within the territorial scope of EU law. Therefore, if an AI model is not developed according to the AI Act, it cannot be offered in the EU, regardless of whether the content used for training has been created by a rightsholder based in the EU or on US territory.

Alternatively, legal scholars suggest that the application of the AI Act could depend on another act of use, namely, on whether the AI provider has crawled data from websites hosted in the EU. This approach is consistent with the specific requirements of the AI Act, such as automatic crawling and the obligation to comply with machine-readable rights reservations. This solution emphasises that if content is hosted in the EU, AI providers should comply with applicable rules in the EU, even if the subsequent training takes place elsewhere.

In summary, while traditional copyright principles may in effect limit territorial application, the AI Act seeks to ensure compliance with EU standards for AI models offered within the EU, potentially extending its reach beyond traditional territorial boundaries.

### Applicability to US Rightsholders

Direct Applicability – The DSM Directive itself does not directly apply to US rightsholders. US rightsholders only benefit from EU Directives if their content is used within the EU.

Indirect Effects – If the content of US rightsholder is affected by uses in the EU territory and is lawfully accessible within the EU, AI companies are marketing their products in the EU and EU-based users are using it, these AI companies must comply with the EU Copyright Directive.

Therefore, US rightsholders may want to consider the instruments provided for their protection by the EU Copyright Directive if they want to control the use of their content within the EU. They can implement the opt-out provision to prevent their content from being used for TDM by AI providers marketing their products in the EU.

### Implementation Considerations

Machine-Readable Opt-Out – US rightsholders can use machine-readable means, such as the International Standard Content Code (ISCC), to identify their works and bind opt-out reservations that express in an automated way that their works should not be used for TDM. This would help ensure that EU-based entities can respect their opt-out.

Practical Steps – US rightsholders should:

1. Assess if their content is accessible within the EU.
2. Implement a machine-readable opt-out if they wish to prevent TDM through content that is accessible and marketed within the EU.
3. Monitor compliance and take necessary actions if their opt-out is not respected.

In summary, while the EU Copyright Directive's opt-out provision is not directly applicable to US rightsholders, it can indirectly apply if an AI model or the AI application is marketed within the EU. Implementing a machine-readable opt-out, using the ISCC as an identifier that can help to point to rights and opt-out reservations, can provide an effective and enforceable instrument to US rightsholders to manage their content's use.
