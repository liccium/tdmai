# Legal aspects

Regulation on Text and Data Mining (TDM) according to the [DSM Directive on Copyright 2019/790](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj), article 4:

1. In the absence of any declaration, the default condition permits Text and Data Mining (TDM) for both scientific and commercial purposes.
2. It's important to note that an opt-out declaration exclusively affects commercial TDM, as there is no provision for opting out of scientific TDM (as this is an exception).
3. Implementing a binding default opt-in system, where AI providers must consistently seek permission to utilise content, would require a substantial revision of the existing DSM, Article 4. Such a revision is currently unlikely.

## Options

### Option 1: Opt-out

When we talk about a "machine-readable opt-out," we're referring to a declaration made by the rightsholder that should be understood as a limitation on commercial TDM usage.

### Option 2: Permission

On the other hand, a "machine-readable permission" indicates that the rightsholder has made a declaration that should be interpreted as them not actively opting out. While one might argue that a machine-readable permission is redundant because permission is the default assumption, there are scenarios where the rightsholder may have initially expressed a machine-readable restriction but subsequently changed their stance.

## Open legal questions

Considering that the DSM only mentions machine-readable opt-outs, the question arises as to whether it would be legally sound to potentially incorporate an opt-in mechanism in conjunction with licensing terms. Is it acceptable or even required to integrate this as a distinct, separate declaration under the law?
