# Requirements

## Issues With Current Approaches

Existing approaches are not effective in cases where:

1. The content is modified or manipulated,
2. Embedded metadata is removed from the media file,
3. Watermarks or steganographic data are removed from the content of the media file,
4. Content is shared&#x20;
   * on websites over which the original rightsholders have no control
   * on social media
5. False claims are made&#x20;
6. Users do not have access to proprietary software or centralised services to verify content declarations

## Requirements For Opt-out Declarations

Opt-out declaration should (be):&#x20;

1. Machine-readable,
2. Based on international standards (ISO, W3C),
3. Inseparably bound to the content (media asset) to enable sharing and distribution of content online and on social media,
4. Resilient to the manipulation of content,&#x20;
5. Resilient to the removal of embedded metadata, watermarks and steganographic data from the media file,
6. Provide verifiable attribution through digital signatures and certificates (creator credentials),
7. Provide a verifiable timestamp.
