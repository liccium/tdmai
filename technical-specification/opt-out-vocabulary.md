# Opt-out Vocabulary

This section defines the controlled vocabulary used to express opt-out declarations under the TDMÂ·AI Protocol. The vocabulary enables machine-readable communication of rights reservations regarding the use of digital content for text and data mining (TDM), AI training, and generative AI training.

The vocabulary is based on the proposal by the Open Future Foundation:\
"A Vocabulary for Opting Out of AI Training and Other Forms of TDM" (07 March 2025)\
Available at: [https://openfuture.eu/publication/a-vocabulary-for-opting-out-of-ai-training-and-other-forms-of-tdm](https://openfuture.eu/publication/a-vocabulary-for-opting-out-of-ai-training-and-other-forms-of-tdm)

The vocabulary is structured hierarchically to reflect legal and technical relationships between different types of uses. Each category can be declared independently, but opt-outs at a higher level imply restrictions on subordinate categories, as described below.

### 1. TDM (Text and Data Mining)&#x20;

**Definition**:&#x20;

The act of using assets in the context of any automated analytical technique aimed at analysing text and data in digital form in order to generate information, including but not limited to patterns, trends, and correlations.

**Implications**:&#x20;

Opting out of TDM automatically includes opting out of AI training and generative AI training.

### 2. AI Training&#x20;

**Definition**:&#x20;

The act of training general-purpose AI models or other types of AI models capable of performing a wide range of tasks, including labeling, classifying, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and semantically understanding content.

**Implications**:&#x20;

Opting out of AI training automatically includes opting out of generative AI training but does not opt out of TDM as a whole.

### 3. TDM for generative AI Training Purposes&#x20;

**Definition**:&#x20;

The act of training general-purpose AI models, improving their capacity to generate text, images, or other forms of synthetic content, or training other types of AI models that have the purpose of generating text, images, or other forms of synthetic content.

**Implications**:&#x20;

Opting out of generative AI training does not automatically include opting out of AI training or TDM unless explicitly stated.
