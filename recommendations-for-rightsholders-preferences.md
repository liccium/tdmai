# Recommendations for Rightsholders' Preferences

##

Liccium's TDMÂ·AI protocol describes the method of "soft-binding" rights reservations to ISCC codes, such as an opt-out declaration. To be effective, rights reservations must be:

* **Inseparably bound to the content** (unit, work or asset based approach), \
  allowing sharing and distribution of content;
* Easily discoverable, accessible and **machine-readable** (legal requirement);
* Functional when **content already has been shared and distributed**;
* Resilient to content manipulation or alteration;
* **Resilient to the removal of embedded metadata** and visible or invisible watermarks;
* Containing verifiable attribution through digital signatures and certificates which authenticate the declaration's source and prevent false claims;&#x20;
* **Functional for all media types and file formats**;
* Utilising verifiable timestamps;
* Based on reliable and transparent international standards (ISO, W3C).
